## CDP Connector Global

The settingsForm file corresponds to a configuration form that was made within a custom module in Drupal 8 and 9 to solve
the sending of CDP that is normally implemented in all the sites of the brand in which I was working.
The form shows the use of ajax and code reuse to be able to generate elements dynamically and then, by implementing a 
service, give correct use to the information collected.
